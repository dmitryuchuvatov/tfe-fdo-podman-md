# How To

## Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/dmitryuchuvatov/tfe-fdo-podman-md.git
```

## Change folder

```
cd tfe-fdo-podman-md
```

## Rename the file called `terraform.tfvars-sample` to `terraform.tfvars` and replace the values with your own.
The current content is below:

```
region            = "eu-west-1"                            # AWS region to deploy in
environment_name  = "tfe-fdo-podman-md"                    # Name of the environment, used in naming of resources
vpc_cidr          = "10.200.0.0/16"                        # The IP range for the VPC in CIDR format
route53_zone      = "tf-support.hashicorpdemo.com"         # The domain of your hosted zone in Route 53
route53_subdomain = "tfe-fdo-podman-md"                    # The subomain of the URL
cert_email        = "dmitry.uchuvatov@hashicorp.com"       # The email address used to register the certificate
tfe_release       = "v202312-1"                            # TFE release version (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/releases)
tfe_password      = "Password1#"                           # TFE encryption password
tfe_license       = "02MV4UU4..."                          # Value from the license file                                   
```

## Set AWS credentials

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=
```

## Terraform init
```
terraform init
```

## Terraform apply

```
terraform apply
```

When prompted, type **yes** and hit **Enter** to start provisioning AWS infrastructure and install TFE on it.

After some time, you should see the similar result:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 25 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

tfe_login =  "https://tfe-fdo-podman-md.tf-support.hashicorpdemo.com"
ssh_login = "ssh -i tfesshkey.pem ec2-user@tfe-fdo-podman-md.tf-support.hashicorpdemo.com
```

## Next steps
It will take ~ 10 minutes to spin up TFE. You can verify this by clicking on the URL from the previous output.

When UI is accessible, [provision your first administrative user](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/initial-admin-user) and start using Terraform Enterprise.
